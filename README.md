# Named Entity Recognition

## AIM

To develop an LSTM-based model for recognizing the named entities in the text.

## Problem Statement and Dataset
we propose a deep neural network (NN) architecture, namely the bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) based model for NER. Based on existing gold standard datasets, we evaluated and compared several models for identifying biomedical named entities. Our deep NN based Bi-LSTM model using word and character level embeddings outperforms CRF and Bi-LSTM using only word level embeddings significantly.
